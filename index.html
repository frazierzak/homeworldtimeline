						<h2>The Beginning</h2>
						<p>The events in Homeworld take place in <strong>The Galaxy</strong>, a spiral galaxy known as the <strong>Whirlpool Galaxy</strong>, is about <strong>76,000 lightyears</strong> in diameter, relatively small for a galaxy in comparison with the <strong>Milky Way</strong>.</p>
						<img class="lazy" data-original="images/galaxy.jpg">
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<p>In spite of its size, the Galaxy has supported <strong>several powerful empires</strong> such as the <strong>Progenitors</strong>, the <strong>Hiigaran Empire</strong>, and the <strong>Taiidan Empire</strong>.</p>
						<img class="lazy" data-original="images/races.png">

						</div>
						<p>The <strong>Naggarok</strong> was an alien exploration vessel that  journeyed to the Galaxy from a neighboring galaxy using an <strong>experimental hyperdrive</strong> of immense power. When the ship emerged from hyperspace it was carrying a <strong>strange and malevolent form of life</strong> (later to be given the moniker <strong>The Beast</strong>) which had not been present at the start of its journey. When the aliens on-board the vessel realized this lifeform's destructive capabilities they decided to destroy the vessels engines and communications array, thus <strong>trapping the creature inside</strong>. However, the ship launched its emergency beacon with a small sample of <strong>Beast</strong> cells on-board.</p>

						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<h2>The Progenitors</h2>
						<p>With the few records we have on them, the <strong>Progenitors</strong> are the oldest known race in the universe. They arrived before the <strong>Galactic Dating System (GDS)</strong> began. Their empire and influence spanned nearly the entire galaxy, and many <strong>Progenitor relics</strong> have been found in its farthest corners.</p>
						<img class="lazy" data-original="images/progenitor_mothership.jpg">
						<p class="caption">Blueprint of the <strong>Progenitor Mothership</strong></p>
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<p>The Progenitors possessed <strong>highly advanced technology</strong> that far surpassed that of all other space-faring civilizations even <strong>millenia after their departure</strong> from the galaxy.</p>
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<p>The Progenitors also developed extremely powerful <strong>hyperdrives</strong> capable of making galactic jumps in less than a second and transporting whole fleets within the galaxy and beyond. This <strong>hyperdrive technology</strong> led to the <strong>Eye of Aarran</strong>, a vast network of self-supported hyperspace gates stretching throughout the galaxy. The Progenitors left their <strong>three Hyperspace cores hidden</strong> in different places throughout the Galaxy.</p>
						<img class="lazy" data-original="images/hyperspace_core.png">
						<p class="caption">One of the three <strong>hyperspace cores</strong></p>
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<h2>The Bentusi</h2>
						<p>The <strong>Bentusi</strong>, an ancient race of space-fairing technology traders, call themselves the <strong>Unbound</strong> which means to be directly connected with their ships. By doing so, the Bentusi are able to <strong>control their ships with direct thought</strong> allowing quick reactions and fewer staff to perform the same operations. They also have <strong>significantly longer lifespans</strong> and refer to other non-unbound races as having <strong>flicker lives</strong>.</p>
						<img class="lazy" data-original="images/bentusi.jpg">
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<p>The earliest known event in <strong>Bentusi history</strong> was when the Bentusi discovered the <strong>First Hyperspace Core</strong> in a massive <strong>Progenitor</strong> ship, becoming the first known race to acquire <strong>far-jump</strong> technology. While others in the galaxy had <strong>hyperspace technology</strong>, none could travel at the distance and speed the <strong>Far-Jumper</strong> would allow. With it, the Bentusi could travel hundreds of light years and more within one or two minutes. Fortunately, the Bentusi used this new-found technology <strong>to keep order and peace in the galaxy</strong>.</p>
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<div class="meta">
							<p class="date">CIRCA 4,000 BHL</p>
						</div>
						<p>Using the hyperspace core, the Bentusi quickly established the <strong>Old Trade Routes</strong> which were widespread across hundreds of worlds, bringing their technology to many races. Soon after, the Bentusi took it upon themselves the mantle <strong>Galactic Peacekeepers</strong>.</p>
						<img class="lazy" data-original="images/old_trade_routes.jpg">
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<p>Using the <strong>far-jumper</strong> housed in their mothership, <strong>Bentus</strong>, the Bentusi could send their entire fleet to quell interplanetary wars with their superior technology. However, many systems did not like being little more than <strong>protectorates</strong> of the Bentusi, and began conspiring with other planets to bring an end to the Bentusi's <strong>"tyranny"</strong>.</p>

						</div>
						<h2>The Uprising</h2>
						<p>Almost overnight, <strong>thousands of wars</strong> broke out across the galaxy. The Bentusi fleet, though indisputably powerful, could not tend to every incident at once. As the dust settled, several new <strong>Empires</strong> had been formed, and the <strong>Galactic Council</strong> was formed from the <strong>Hiigaran</strong>, <strong>Taiidan</strong>, and 14 other empires. <strong>The Bentusi supremacy had ended</strong>.</p>
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<p>Of the many empires that emerged stronger after Bentusi's reign was lost, the <strong>Hiigarans</strong> gain control of all the planets under the <strong>Daiamid</strong>, their governing council. The Hiigarans are a <strong>humanoid race</strong> hailing from <strong>Hiigara</strong> at the edge of the <strong>Galactic Core</strong>. Through their trials they have proven to be a group of <strong>proud, cunning and intellectual people</strong>.</p>
						<img class="lazy" data-original="images/hiigaran.jpg">
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<p>Another to gained power from Bentusi's fall was the <strong>Taiidan Empire</strong>, also known as the <strong>Taiidan Imperium</strong>, which was <strong>one of the oldest states</strong> in the Galaxy. The Taiidan and Hiigaran Empires shared the same area of space.</p>
						<img class="lazy" data-original="images/taiidan.png">
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<h2>War Between Hiigara and Taiidan</h2>
						<p><strong>Bad blood</strong> between the Hiigaran and Taiidan led to many disputes among border planets of their respected empires. With tensions and battles increasing, the Galactic Council intervened and favored with the Taiidan Empire. The Taiidans had <strong>bribed, blackmailed, and even assassinated</strong> members of the Council to insure they gained the upper-hand in the dispute. Along with <strong>many planets awarded to the Taiidans</strong>, the Council also<strong> forbid the Hiigarans</strong> from entering a <strong>30 light-year zone</strong> and in doing so would return <strong>serious reprisals</strong>.</p>
						<img class="lazy" data-original="images/border-disputes.png">
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<p>It seemed all hope was lost for the Hiigaran Empire, until exploration of the <strong>Great Wastelands</strong> unearthed an artifact that would prove to be the most important discovery in their history. The <strong>Second Hyperspace Core</strong>.</p>
						<img class="lazy" data-original="images/second_core.jpg">
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<p>With extensive re-engineering of the containment unit, it is mounted within the <strong>Sajuuk's Wrath</strong>, the newly constructed <strong>flagship</strong> of the Hiigarans.</p>
						<img class="lazy" data-original="images/sajuuks_wrath.png">
						<p class="caption">The only known drawing of <strong>Sajuuk's Wrath</strong> compared in size to a super carrier</p>
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<p>Unfortunately, the Higgarans abused the power of the <strong>Hyperspace Core</strong> and jumped deep into Taiidan Empire territory, attacking many border patrols. Before the first report of attack reached the <strong>Imperial Palace</strong> on the planet <strong>Taiidan</strong>, the Hiigaran fleet was already above its orbit and began using <strong>Low Orbit Atmospheric Deprivation Weapons</strong> and killing the emperor himself. The Hiigarans then departed, satisfied that the threat of the Taiidan Empire was <strong>neutralized</strong>.</p>
						<img class="lazy" data-original="images/planet_bombed.png">
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<p>The Galactic Council reach a decision <strong>much faster</strong> than the Hiigarans had expected. The Hiigarans are <strong>forced to abandon every vessel</strong> belonging to them that existed within the 30-light-year exclusion zone, <strong>turn over their Hyperspace Core</strong> and <strong>retreat from the worlds they had conquered</strong>. The Hiigarans are given <strong>24 hours</strong> to comply or face the <strong>severest consequences</strong>.</p>
						<img class="lazy" data-original="images/galatic_council.jpg">
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<p>The Hiigarans send word to the Galactic Council, informing them that <strong>they agreed to the stated conditions</strong>. However, they plan to give the core <strong>only to the Bentusi</strong>. As Bentus came closer to <strong>Sajuuk's Wrath</strong> to extract the Hyperspace Core, the fleet powers up under emergency procedures and <strong>attack Bentus</strong> before it can react.</p>
						<img class="lazy" data-original="images/bentus_attack.jpg">
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<p>However, the Bentusi had <strong>more experience</strong> and capabilities than the Hiigarans. Bentus launched combat-ready vessels, while their own Hyperspace Core jumped other Bentusi Exchanges into the heart of battle from nearby staging grounds. While the Hiigarans fought on, <strong>Sajuuk's Wrath leapt from flank to flank</strong>, blinking in and out of hyperspace and bolstering the Hiigaran forces wherever it was needed, <strong>the Bentus outmaneuvered it each time</strong>. After many hours of solid, bloody combat, there was <strong>nothing left</strong> of the Hiigaran Navy <strong>beyond debris and their Flagship</strong>. The Bentusi <strong>offered surrender</strong> and the Hiigarans <strong>refused</strong>. The Bentus <strong>destroyed the engines</strong> of Sajuuk's Wrath in an effort to <strong>preserve the Hyperspace Core</strong>. Instead, the Hiigaran commander <strong>jumped Sajuuk's Wrath into the Gravity Well of Angel Moon</strong>, destroying the ship and <strong>presumably</strong> the Core as well. It's said that the <strong>Daiamid</strong> had been told of the suicide plan before the attack, and knew where to look for the core <strong>in the future</strong>. </p>
						<img class="lazy" data-original="images/sajuuks_wrath_crashed.jpg">
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<p>In the aftermath of the overwhelming Hiigaran defeat, the Galactic Council granted the remaining Hiigarans their freedom under the condition that they would <strong>never again prepare for war or bring arms against others</strong>.
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<p>The Bentusi felt <strong>responsible</strong> for stripping the power of hyperspace from the Hiigarans who were <strong>immature</strong> in using its ability. They had made errors of their own and easily saw that they too could have been in the same situation as the Hiigaran if another, older race had the power before them. <strong>A time of mourning was at hand</strong>, and the Bentusi <strong>disarmed and demilitarized every vessel</strong> they commanded. They vowed <strong>never to wage war for the cause of peace</strong> and to never have influence on the Council again.</p>
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<h2>Riesstiu's Revenge</h2>
						<p>Without an emperor, the Taiidan Empire was in <strong>disarray</strong>. <strong>Admiral Riesstiu</strong>, the only remnant of their once fearsome navy, <strong>declared himself the sole commander</strong> of the Navy. He acted quickly and brought <strong>justice</strong> to each Hiigaran border planet, forcing them to <strong>join or die</strong>. The Taiidan had developed weapons that would <strong>cleanse the entire surface of a planet</strong> and were horribly eager to use them on each planet which refused to be a part of the Taiidan Empire. <strong>Hundreds of millions of lives were ended</strong> without warning for a crime of which they were ultimately innocent. Some of the planets had <strong>"converted too easily"</strong> according to the admiral and razed them anyway. More lives were lost in the space of <strong>Riesstiu's Revenge</strong> than had been lost in all recorded battles since the Outer Rim Trade Routes were first established.</p>
						<img class="lazy" data-original="images/border_planet_bombed.png">
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<p>The Galactic Council threatened <strong>sanctions</strong> against Riesstiu and the Taiidan, but they <strong>carried on without care</strong>. The Council and independent worlds <strong>called for the Bentusi</strong> to intervene with force - yet they would not. Instead they volunteered to <strong>adjudicate discussion</strong> between Riesstiu and the Hiigaran Diamid in pursuit of an <strong>acceptable resolution</strong>.</p>
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<div class="meta">
							<p class="date">CIRCA 5500 GSY</p>
						</div>
						<h2>The Fate of Hiigara</h2>
						<p>The admiral's demands were <strong>simple</strong>, all Hiigaran worlds would now belong to the Taiidan Empire. Hiigara itself would be the <strong>new site of the Imperial Palace</strong>. Every native Hiigaran would be <strong>executed or pressed into slavery</strong> depending on their level of involvement in the war upon Taiidan's Homeworld. <strong>The Diamid</strong> could not move the admiral on any point and the Hiigarans, who had completely <strong>given up hope on a life worth living</strong>, prepared for the <strong>end</strong>.</p>
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<p>The <strong>Bentusi</strong>, shamed by their part in the Hiigaran downfall, continued to negotiate with the <strong>Galactic Council</strong>, the <strong>Hiigaran Diamid</strong>, and <strong>Admiral Riesstiu of the Taiidan</strong>. The finally came to a common ground. The Hiigarans would have a single month to board a <strong>sub-light transport fleet</strong> departing towards the galactic outskirts of the established trade routes. Any left behind would be enslaved or executed, but those willing to accept the arrangement would be <strong>dispatched</strong>. The one thing they must <strong>never</strong> do again: <strong>develop Far Jump hyperspace technology</strong>. If they were to venture beyond their planet with the now-missing core or another like it, <strong>their destruction would be sealed</strong>. The Hiigarans agreed because they did not have a better chance at survival other than exile.</p>

						<p>Before leaving their home system, the Hiigarans secretly retrieve the <strong>Second Hyperspace Core</strong> from the <strong>Angel Moon</strong> and stow it upon a <strong>Khar-Toba</strong> ship. They hoped one day <strong>their ancestors</strong> may have the chance to regain their home and <strong>their empire</strong>.</p>

						<h2>The Exile Begins</h2>
						<p>As the Hiigarans hyperspaced to the outskirts, <strong>several generations lived and died</strong> aboard the ships. When they came to the <strong>Great Nebula</strong>, at least one of the vessels broke off and sought shelter there. This was the beginning of the <strong>Kadeshi</strong>, former Hiigarans developed in isolation in their nebula which they called <strong>"The Garden"</strong>. This later became the <strong>center of their religion</strong> and served as <strong>sanctuary</strong> that allowed them to <strong>thrive as a people once more</strong>.</p>
						<img class="lazy" data-original="images/kadeshi_mothership.jpg">
						<p class="caption">A <strong>Kadeshi Mothership</strong> in <strong>The Garden</strong></p>
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<p>There's little record of how the Kadeshi developed over the years, but what is known is that they built large needle-shaped motherships and developed <strong>hyperspace inhibitors</strong> to <strong>capture and prevent ships</strong> from leaving the Nebula. Anyone who visits their sanctuary must either join or die since their visit defiled <strong>The Garden</strong>.</p>
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<div class="meta">

						<h2>A New Home for Hiigarans</h2>
						<p>The Hiigaran exiles continued their journey until stumbling upon <strong>Kharak</strong>, an <strong>Outer Rim desert planet</strong> marked by large bands of <strong>erg deserts</strong> stretching across the equator, to more temperate, cool climates towards the <strong>north and south poles</strong>. This would be their new <strong>home</strong>.</p>
	  					<img class="lazy" data-original="images/kharak.jpg">
	  					<p class="caption">The desert planet of <strong>Kharak</strong>, the Hiigarans' new home</p>
	  					<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
	  					<p>With only five remaining vessels left, the Hiigarans descended upon Kharak. During planetfall, the ships suffered extreme damage and only one survived re-entry: The Khar Toba containing the <strong>Second Hyperspace Core</strong>. The remaining Hiigarans exiles formed the first city which they rightfully named <strong>Khar-Toba</strong> since it was <strong>built within and from the ship itself</strong>.</p>
						<img class="lazy" data-original="images/khar_toba_city.jpg">
						<p class="caption">The first Kharak city, <strong>Khar-Toba</strong></p>
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<p>The city of Khar-Toba housed a network of tunnels and buildings. The Hyperspace core was moved from inside the ship to a shielded underground chamber, serving as a power plant for the city. It is suspected to have fallen when the <strong>hyperspace core failed</strong> After the city's collapse, the remaining Hiigarans expanded across Kharak and grow into a large populace of <strong>Kushan</strong>, most leaving the history of the Hiigaran people behind and some even <strong>forgotten</strong>. The <strong>malfunctioned hyperspace core</strong> is left in Khar-Toba.</p>
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<p>The Hyperspace Core eventually became so unstable it began to cause <strong>severe issues</strong> for passing ships in the system. Some were caused to <strong>crash into the surface</strong> while others were <strong>jumped out of space into the planet</strong>. One of the ships that suffered this fate was a <strong>Taiidan carrier</strong> which was in the process of deploying an <strong>orbital weapon</strong> to prevent the Kushan from <strong>returning to space</strong>.</p>

						<h2>Rise of the Kiiths</h2>
						<p>The Kushan of Kharak make up multiple clans, known as <strong>kiith</strong>. The <strong>Kiith Manaan</strong> are one of the <strong>first kiith recorded</strong>. They are a mysterious and elusive kiith widely known as <strong>nomads or thieves</strong> depending on which kiith you ask. Instead of settling and doing hard labor, they travel from kiith to kiith, <strong>entertaining and trading</strong>. They specialized in <strong>rare medicines, drugs, and other taboo items</strong>.</p>

						</div>
						<p><strong>Kiith Soban</strong>, also known as the <strong>Grey Brotherhood</strong>, is formed. A mercenary kiith, their origins lie in a man named <strong>Soban the Red</strong>. He led a small group of families from their home kiith after its leaders refused to retaliate to an attack by a rival, more powerful kiith. Soban brought his small band across the <strong>Sparkling Desert</strong> and brought the news of his kiith's destruction to the <strong>Kiith-Sa</strong>. He offered to lead an army that would strike back at the destroyers but the Kiith-Sa had intentions of joining them instead.</p>
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<p>Upon hearing this, Soban the Red <strong>ripped the colors of his kiith</strong> and left it all behind. With his followers he declared he would never belong to another kiith that would have deaf ears to the <strong><em>blood of children crying from the ground</em></strong>. He then formed <strong>Kiith Soban</strong>. Their first act was to attack the kiith that had originally destroyed their home and did not leave <strong><em>a single blade of grass green</em></strong>. From that day forward, Kiith Soban became known as a <strong>truly deadly warrior kiith</strong> with no home, roaming the desert from battle to battle.</p>

						<p>The <strong>Siidim Council</strong> announced a change in its theology, from the traditional view that the Kushan were <strong>exiled from paradise</strong> to Kharak as punishment for the sin of arrogance, to the belief that only those within Kiith Siidim were of <strong>divine origin</strong>. According to the Siidim kiith-sa, all other kiith were natives to Kharak, and therefore <strong>inferior</strong>.</p>

						<h2>The Heresy Wars</h2>
						<p>In the era of the <strong>Heresy Wars</strong>, multiple kiith are in conflict with regards to religion and territorial considerations.</p>

						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<p>Conflict came to a head when the two largest Kiith in the north, the <strong>Kiith Siidim</strong> and <strong>Kiith Gaalsien</strong>, went to war over the issue of what had caused the gods to place them on such a world. The Kiith Siidim believed that the Kushan were once a great race living in paradise but had been punished by the gods for their hubris and cast down to Kharak. The Kiith Gaalsien believed this idea to be heretical arrogance in light of their belief that they had been created to suffer from the beginning and Kharak was all they could hope for.</p>
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<p>The conflict eventually spread to the southern zone as well. The Heresy Wars left the Kushan people on the <strong>brink of extinction</strong> with precious resources and infrastructure destroyed during <strong>three centuries</strong> of religious conflict.</p>

						<p>With all factions exhausted and falling from internal anarchy, a small clan, from the settlement at <strong>Tiir</strong>, emerged from hiding. This Northern Clan was the first to develop <strong>chemical explosives</strong> and was thus unmatched in clan warfare. They also preached a world view <strong>based on science and logic</strong> and offered protection to anyone who wished to live in such a world.</p>

						<p>Within <strong>20 years</strong>, <strong>Tiir was the new capital</strong> of Kharak and the <strong>Time of Reason</strong> era had begun.</p>

						<h2>The Time Of Reason Era</h2>
						<p><strong>Space Exploration</strong> was not greeted favorably by the entire population. Large factions from some of the poorer clans believed technology and industrial output was being wasted on the effort. They thought it would be put to better use on trying to alter Kharak or at least discover ways to support more people and hold back the encroaching deserts.</p>
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<p>As final preparations for the <strong>first orbital flight</strong> were being made, an obscure theologian named <strong>Per Doine</strong> provided the unifying force for these factions by resurrecting the old myth that <strong>tragedy would befall our people</strong> should we offend the gods with another act of arrogance.</p>
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<p>This <strong>religious revival</strong> spread throughout both polar territories and it culminated with an attempt by a frenzied mob to tear down the <strong>Silumiin Launch Vehicle</strong> on the eve of its liftoff. This was averted by the <strong>High Tecnhocrats</strong> who stood on the <strong>launch base turrets</strong>, preventing them from firing on the crowd. This lasted for <strong>14 hours</strong>.</p>
						<img class="lazy" data-original="images/launch_site.jpg">
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<p><strong>Per Doine</strong> slipped through the cordon and prayed for salvation beneath the <strong>rocket's main engines</strong> and was <strong>vaporized on ignition</strong>, becoming a <strong>martyr</strong> for the cause.</p>
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<p>Meanwhile, <strong>biological and chemical sciences</strong> revealed a disturbing lack of commonality between the Kushan's biochemcial makeup and that of most Kharakid life. Ironically, it was the birth of the <strong>Daiamid Movement</strong>, with its many scientific breakthroughs, that created a philosophical environment where the oldest myths and the newest theories could be wedded into what was now accepted as the <strong>XenoGenesis Theory</strong>. This theory assumed that the Kushans were <strong>aliens to Kharak</strong>.</p>
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<p>The <strong>Age of Orbital Exploration</strong> revealed the first clues that the Kushan were not indigenous to Kharak. Reports of <strong>metallic debris</strong> in high orbit soon led to dedicated <strong>retrieval missions</strong>, with surprising results. Initial analysis made it obvious these were pieces of <strong>advanced manufactured and machined structures</strong>. This was yet another piece to the puzzle of Kushan origins, but it did not truly confirm anything except that some kind of <strong>alien device or ship</strong> had once orbited Kharak.</p>
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<p>The discovery of this tiny debris belt spurred <strong>great leaps</strong> in <strong>metallurgy and manufacturing</strong> simply by showing that exotic, high tensile composite materials could exist. This in turn led to advances in <strong>propulsion</strong> and advanced <strong>shielding systems</strong>. The combinations of these spurred the fledging space program <strong>even further</strong> and first steps <strong>became leaps.</strong></p>

						<p>A satellite orbiting the planet <strong>Kharak</strong> detects an enormous object underneath the <strong>Great Desert</strong>. The people of Kharak, the <strong>Kushan</strong>, excavate the site to discover the remains of a large city surrounding the wreckage of an ancient ship, which they named the <strong>Khar-Toba</strong>. </p>

						<p>Inside the vessel, the Kushan discovered vast amounts of technology, far more advanced than anything seen before. The most impressive piece of technology was the <strong>hyperdrive module</strong>. The Kushan salvaged this hyperdrive and explored further through the ruins, naming the ship and surrounding city as the Khar-Toba.</p>
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<p>Also discovered was the <strong>Guidestone</strong>, containing a map written in an ancient language to a planet called <strong>Hiigara</strong>, which translated to <strong>"Our Home"</strong> in Kushan.</p>
						<img class="lazy" data-original="images/guidestone.png">
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<p>This finding proved that the Kushan did not originate from Kharak and spurred them into building a <strong>Mothership</strong> that would take them to their homeworld.</p>
						<img class="lazy" data-original="images/mothership.jpg">
						<div class="timeline-bar"></div>
						<p>During construction, <strong>Karan S'jet</strong>, a young and brilliant neuroscientist, integrated her body and mind with the Mothership to establish full control of all systems. She then became known as <strong>Fleet Command</strong>.</p>

	  		<h1>About</h1>
	  		<p>This is a project I created because there's very little resources outside of the wiki for the <strong>Homeworld</strong> story. Especially resources that are in chronological format. The whole site is done in HTML/CSS and my sources are listed below. You can click the <a href="mailto:homeworldtimeline@gmail.com?Subject=Homeworld%20Timeline%20Submission" target="_top">Submit</a> button at the top to shoot me an email for changes/additions for the site. Any help is greatly appreciated!</p>
	  		<p>With <strong>Deserts of Kharak</strong> coming out soon, I figured now is a better time than ever to make something like this. I hope others find the story as amazing as I do.</p>
	  		<p>Though I hate to ask, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=3J3RCBBFP2ANQ&lc=US&item_name=Homeworld%20Timeline%20Servers&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted">donations</a> are also greatly appreciated. Server and domain costs come out to around <strong>$30</strong> a year so if you don't mind throwing a buck or two my way, I couldn't be more grateful.</p>
